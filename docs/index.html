          The world as we know it shall never know peace and it is up to the

            There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count
            orbiting our star: eight. The inner, rocky planets are Mercury,
            Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed
            on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter
            and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Beyond Neptune, a
            newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including
            longtime favorite Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered
            beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means
            "from outside")

            Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and
            wind that are naturally replenished and do not run out. Renewable
            energy can be used for electricity generation, space and water
            heating and cooling, and transportation. Non-renewable energy, in
            contrast, comes from finite sources that could get used up, such as
            fossil fuels like coal and oil.

            Food systems depend on natural resources. But population growth, and
            dietary changes due to growing wealth, are creating pressures on
            those resources. Transforming our food systems is required if we are
            to meet future demands. Global food systems have radically changed
            over the last 50 years. Food production has more than doubled, diets
            have become more varied (and often more energy-intense) satisfying
            people’s preferences in terms of form, taste and quality, and
            numerous local, national and multi-national food-related enterprises
            have emerged providing livelihoods for millions. Nonetheless, over
            800 million people are still hungry (70% of whom live in rural areas
            in developing countries), about two billion suffer from poor
            nutrition, and over two billion are overweight or obese. The
            resource use implications and environmental impacts of these food
            systems are significant.
